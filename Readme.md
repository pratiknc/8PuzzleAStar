Project name:
<br>The 8-puzzle problem implemented as part of this project will be solved using a 3x3 matrix that takes in 
<br>an initial state of the grid as well as the goal state. Based on these user inputs, we will solve the problem 
<br>using one heuristic at a time. 
<br>The program will return the cost of solving the problem, i.e., the total cost to reach the goal node from 
<br>initial input node. In case we end up in a situation where no solution is possible, the code will return “No 
<br>solution found!”.
<br>
<br>Prerequisites:
<br>Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<br>• You have installed Python version 3.7+ and default python version is also set to 3.7+
<br>All Operating Systems are supported.
<br>
<br>Usage:
<br>1. Extract the zip file on desired path.
<br>2. Navigate to 8Puzzle-AStar folder.
<br>3. Run 8Puzzle-AStar.py –
<br>python 8Puzzle-AStar.py
<br>
<br>On execution, follow the prompts.
<br>
<br>Example –
<br>Enter comma separated start state, 0 signifies blank tile:
<br>1,2,3,4,6,5,7,8,0
<br>Enter comma separated goal state, 0 signifies blank tile:
<br>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0
<br>Choose Heuristic function to use
<br>Enter 1 for manhattan distance
<br>Enter 2 for misplaced tile
